<!-- We already seen many semantic htmls elements like 
    - <nav>
    - Single <h1> in the html file but we can have multiple <h2> or <h3> elements in the same page. 
    - <hr> also have a semantic element. 

    The word semantic means it gives some meaning!

    # Some of the tags to avoid
    1. <div> -> NO meaning at all. 
    2. <span> -> We just use this for css, don't use this.
